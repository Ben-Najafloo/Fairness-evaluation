# Fairness-evaluation
This script uses pandas for data handling, scikit-learn for metrics, and the aif360 library for fairness-specific evaluations. It evaluates fairness with respect to a sensitive attribute (e.g., gender, race) and computes metrics such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and statistical parity difference.
